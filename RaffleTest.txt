The it() function is another function provided by the Mocha testing framework,
 and is used to define an individual test case within a describe block.

 describe("constructor", async function(){
        it("Initializes the Raffle correctly ", async function(){
            //
        })
    })

The purpose of this test case is to verify that the constructor function initializes the Raffle smart contract correctly.
The async function passed as the second argument to it contains the actual test code that will be run when this test case
 is executed.

Possible test cases that could be run to ensure that the constructor function initializes the Raffle contract correctly include:

Check that the initial raffleState is set to "Open"
Check that the owner of the contract is set to the correct Ethereum address
Check that the ticketPrice is set to the correct value
Check that the minimumPlayers is set to the correct value
Check that the players array is initialized to an empty array
Check that the playerMap mapping is initialized correctly (if applicable)
